# What it is
This is a tiny set of scripts that will automatically configure your [vim](http://www.vim.org/) installation to use [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) package manager. 
Out of the box, it comes pre-configured with:

- [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
- [vim-colorschemes](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes)
- [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)

# How to get it

    git clone https://github.com/krixi/vimazing.git ~/.vim


# How to use it

    ~/.vim/setup
    
Congratulations, you are up and running!

# Additional configuration
If you want to set up additional Vundle packages or further customize your vim experience, simply edit this file, and re-run setup:

    vi ~/.vim/vimrc
    (make changes)
    ~/.vim/setup
    
Enjoy!
